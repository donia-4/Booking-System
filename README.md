# Booking-System
I  created a minimal “booking” system: each checkout from .NET Dev #3 spawns a new “booking record.” Then travelers can post a review for each package they booked. Endpoints must allow retrieval of a user’s booking history and package reviews. No external DB needed—everything is static/in-memory.
